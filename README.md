# DamsoAPI
I made an API by myself

I learn how to do it with youtube videos, online documentation and my webknowledge.
For that I used WAMP server for a database and Visual Studio Code.
I Built this API with Python and the modules Fastapi, Flask, sqalchemy.

DamsoAPI.py is the main file where is the code, if you want to execute the API you should start the startapi.py file.
