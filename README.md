# DamsoAPI
I learn how to make an API from scratch, I learn the concept online and then I build one : 

I learn how to do it with youtube videos, online documentation and my webknowledge.
For that I used WAMP server for a database and Visual Studio Code.
I Built this API with Python and the modules Fastapi, Flask, sqalchemy.

DamsoAPI.py is the main file where is the code, if you want to execute the API you should start the startapi.py file.

- In the apitest folder, you can find simple code to test the different method for my API : GET, POST, DELETE.
- In the bddrequest folder, you can find simple code to test my database : SELECT, DELETE, INSERT INTO.
